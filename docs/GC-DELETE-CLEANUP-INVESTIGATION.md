# GC Library-Delete Cleanup — Investigation & Follow-up Debt

**Date:** 2026-07-09
**Branch where found:** `fix/gc-block-representation-durability` (PR #123)
**Status:** partially fixed on PR #123 (representation stamping + Phase 13 recovery);
the remaining items below are **out of scope for #123** and should be done on a
dedicated follow-up branch.

## Context

While validating the PR #123 fix for "soft-deleted libraries stuck permanently in
trash", we ran the full test suite against a clean dev cluster and inspected
Cassandra + MinIO directly. The admin dashboard correctly shows **0 libraries /
0 bytes**, and that is faithful: `libraries` and every admin projection
(`libraries_by_id`, `libraries_by_owner`, `libraries_by_org_updated`,
`libraries_admin_global_by_updated`, `libraries_deleted_by_org`) are all `0`, and
every `storage_counters` scope reads `0` bytes.

**But the physical storage is not empty**, and that revealed cleanup gaps that are
broader than the representation-stamping bug PR #123 fixes.

### Dev cluster access (for reproducing)

- Cassandra: `docker exec sesamefs-cassandra-1 cqlsh -u cassandra -p dev-cassandra-admin` (keyspace `sesamefs`). Creds in `.env` (`CASSANDRA_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`, app user `sesamefs_app`).
- MinIO: `docker exec sesamefs-minio-1 mc ...` (root creds in `$MINIO_ROOT_USER`/`$MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`). Buckets: `sesamefs-blocks/eu/usa/china/archive`.

### Observed residue after a clean-DB full test run (2026-07-09 ~22:06)

| Table | Count | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `libraries` (+ all projections) | 0 | dashboard correct |
| `storage_counters` | all 0 bytes | accounting correct |
| `deleted_libraries` | 0 | GC markers fully drained (the #123 fix works) |
| `gc_queue` / `gc_failed_items` / `gc_block_candidates` | 0 | GC believes it is done |
| `blocks` | 13 | physical blocks still present |
| `block_references` | 7 | 3 provisional + 4 permanent |
| `block_id_mappings` | 9 | |
| `commits` | 4 | |
| `gc_provisional_block_refs` | 12 | expire 2026-07-11 (2-day TTL) |
| `gc_libraries_by_policy` | 2 | stale, libraries gone |
| MinIO objects | 17 | not empty |

## Findings

### F1 — [High] Permanent block references to deleted libraries leak blocks + S3 objects

Of the 7 `block_references`, 3 are provisional (`up:` / `up:sync:` referrers, 2-day
TTL → self-clean, **not** a leak) and **4 are permanent references to libraries
that no longer exist**:

```
fs:24236472-…:97dbb4a…            library 24236472 (gone)
fs:cc63584e-…:700301c9…           library cc63584e (gone)
pub:foreign-1783634787505051209   library e6afcaf3 (gone)
pub:foreign-1783633981107965697   library ce4beeb1 (gone)
```

A block keeps a `block_references` row per referrer; a block only becomes a GC
candidate at **zero references**. These 4 blocks keep a permanent reference whose
library is already hard-deleted, so they never reach zero-ref, never enter
`gc_block_candidates`, and their `blocks` row + MinIO object leak forever.

Root cause: the direct library hard-delete paths delete the `libraries` row but do
**not** remove the library's permanent block references (`fs:` refs from committed
fs_objects, `pub:foreign:` refs from the published/CAS foreign-block path). Those
refs are normally removed by the GC cascade
(`removeFSObjectBlockReferences` per fs_object). If the cascade never ran for the
library — because the content was never enqueued (the permanent-delete
content-leak, see F4) — the refs survive the library.

`pub:foreign:` refs specifically come from the CAS / web-block-upload publish flow
and may have their own cleanup path that is not wired to library deletion.

### F2 — [Med] `gc_libraries_by_policy` stale entries after direct delete

Two `gc_libraries_by_policy` rows (`version_ttl=90`) reference libraries that no
longer exist (`80d85d6f…`, `4dbca9d4…`).

Root cause confirmed in code: `db.AddDeleteLibraryPolicyQuery` (which removes the
policy index row) is called from the GC cascade
(`store_cassandra.go` `HardDeleteLibrary`), from settings/TTL edit endpoints, and
from `write_helpers.go` hard-delete helper — but **not** from the direct delete
paths `deleted_libraries.go` (`PermanentDeleteRepo`), the `admin_libraries.go`
clean-trash batch, or `org_admin_repos.go`. A policy-bearing library deleted via
those paths (without going through the cascade) leaks its policy index row.

Impact: **benign** — the scanner re-reads the `libraries` row for each policy
entry and `continue`s on `ErrNotFound`, so stale entries are skipped, not
mis-processed. But they accumulate and add scan work. Same *class* of gap as the
`deleted_libraries.block_representation_id` stamping gap fixed on #123, in the same
delete paths.

### F3 — [Med] Tests may bypass canonical delete paths and manufacture drift

Several tests write `deleted_libraries` (and delete `libraries`) with **raw CQL**
instead of the canonical helpers, e.g.:

- `internal/integration/library_projection_regression_test.go:2039` — `INSERT INTO deleted_libraries (library_id, org_id, deleted_at, storage_class)` (no `block_representation_id`)
- `internal/integration/gc_block_representation_resolve_test.go:76` — same, unstamped

Because these bypass `softDeleteLibrary` / the permanent-delete handlers, they
create exactly the unstamped markers and orphaned references we are trying to
eliminate, and they run against the shared dev keyspace. This both (a) pollutes
the dev DB with drift and (b) means the tests are not exercising the real
production write paths. Any test that creates or deletes a library for a
non-representation reason should route through the canonical write helpers (or a
shared test helper that mirrors them) rather than hand-rolled CQL.

**Action for the follow-up branch:** audit every raw `INSERT INTO
deleted_libraries` / `DELETE FROM libraries` / raw `block_references` write under
`internal/**/*_test.go` and either route through canonical helpers or justify +
stamp them explicitly.

### F4 — [High, FIXED on #123] Permanent-delete content leak

`PermanentDeleteRepo` deletes the `libraries` row and then (in a goroutine) calls
`EnqueueLibraryDeletion` → `EnqueueLibraryContents` → resolves the representation
against the now-missing row → fails → contents never enqueued → blocks/fs_objects/
commits leak. PR #123 mitigates this by stamping the marker before the delete so
resolution can fall back to it. F1 shows there is still residual leaked content
from *before* the fix / from other paths, and that the block-ref removal itself is
not part of the delete path.

## What PR #123 fixed (keep)

- `deleted_libraries.block_representation_id` is now stamped at all production
  delete writers (`write_helpers.softDeleteLibrary`, `deleted_libraries.go`,
  `admin_libraries.go`, `org_admin_repos.go` ×2).
- New `db.ResolveBlockRepresentationIDForDelete` reads the row even when
  `deleted_at` is already set (permanent delete acts on an already-trashed lib).
- GC Phase 13 **recovers** an unstamped marker from the surviving library row
  instead of fail-closed-skipping it, and emits `gc_library_representation_defaulted`.
- Phase 13 recovery must be **kept** even after all writers stamp correctly, to
  repair pre-deploy / legacy / partial-failure markers.

## Proposed work for the follow-up branch

1. **Centralize library hard-delete cleanup** in a single helper/batch builder so
   no delete path can forget a step. It must, atomically:
   - resolve + validate representation (fail-closed for hard-delete, see PR #123
     review),
   - stamp `deleted_libraries.block_representation_id`,
   - remove the library's permanent block references (`fs:` and `pub:foreign:`),
     decrementing to zero-ref so blocks become GC candidates,
   - delete `gc_libraries_by_policy` rows (both `version_ttl` and `auto_delete`),
   - enqueue the library contents for GC.
2. **Fix the `pub:foreign:` block-ref cleanup** for deleted libraries (understand
   who owns those refs — CAS/publish path — and ensure library deletion releases
   them).
3. **Audit tests** (F3): route library create/delete through canonical helpers.
4. **Reconcile job / backfill** for already-leaked blocks + S3 orphans and stale
   policy rows on existing clusters.
5. **N+1 in bulk cleaners** (see PR #123 review [Med/Low]): fold `encrypted` +
   `block_representation_id` into the trash-listing query instead of one extra
   read per library.

## One-off dev cleanup commands (test cruft only)

```bash
docker exec sesamefs-cassandra-1 cqlsh -u cassandra -p dev-cassandra-admin \
  -e "TRUNCATE sesamefs.gc_libraries_by_policy;"
# Leaked blocks/refs/objects need a proper reconcile; TRUNCATE-ing block_references
# without deleting the S3 objects would orphan MinIO further — do a real GC/reconcile
# pass on the follow-up branch instead of blind truncation.
```
